# AM-Practicum-FInal-Project
This project works with hand movement and hand state(open/closed), to swipe images, move pointer,play video, pause video.
make sure to start both detection functions, the function for movement, and the function for hand state.
there are two .js files, one for hand state, and anothe one for pointer and swipe images. json files are for the mode, I trained a model 
to detect the hand state open or closed, I made two classes with the model.
links which helped me mentioned in the code files.
